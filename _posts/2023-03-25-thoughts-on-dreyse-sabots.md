How can we produce authentic sabots ("Zündspiegel", "Spiegel") for the Langblei bullet? Since I was not able to find any documentation on the machines used in producing the sabots, I need to find a way to re-create what is described in the literature. While there are some contradictory or at least ambiguous descriptions of what the sabots were like, I would like to sum up what I think is consensus.

1. The sabots were rolled up from paper strips around a central pin.
2. The rolled-up paper strips were then pressed and (simultaneously) equipped with an ignition pill ("Zündpille").
3. At some point, the strips were glued or pasted together.
4. The sabots received two cross-wise cuts at their front side.

Future posts will elaborate on selected aspects of the above list, moving as far towards authentic reproduction of Dreyse sabots as possible.
