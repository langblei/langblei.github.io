How can we produce authentic sabots ("Zündspiegel", "Spiegel") for the Langblei bullet? Since I was not able to find any documentation on the machines used in producing the sabots, I need to find a way to re-create what is described in the literature. While there are some contradictory or at least ambiguous descriptions of what the sabots were like, I would like to sum up what I think is consensus.

1. The sabots were rolled up from paper strips around a central pin.
2. The rolled-up paper strips were then pressed and (simultaneously) equipped with an ignition pill ("Zündpille").
3. At some point, the strips were glued or pasted together.
4. The sabots received two cross-wise cuts at their front side.

Having neither seen an original sabot nor a high-resolution picture of one, I cannot say for sure if and how the rolling was oriented with respect to the shooting direction. However, I suggest that the sabots were rolled clockwise when viewed from the rear. In this way, the rifling (turning clockwise on a Dreyse rifle) would tend to tighten the roll against the much heavier bullet's inertia. Rolled up in the opposite way, the sabots would loosen up due to shear stress and would neither guide the bullet properly nor communicate the spin from the rifling to the bullet.
