Having neither seen an original sabot nor a high-resolution picture of one, I cannot say for sure if and how the rolling was oriented with respect to the shooting direction. As of now, the only picture I can refer to is this one by Wilhelm von Pl√∂nnies (see [this post](../historical-references-for-dreyse-sabots) for details):

| Drawing shown an intermediate state of the Spiegel production, specifically after rolling it up (this "raw" sabot is oriented such that the flying direction would be downward) |

The image suggests that the sabots were rolled counterclockwise as viewed from the future shooter's perspective (i.e. from the rear). Since it is merely a sketch focusing on the shape of the spindle, the winding direction might not be correct, though. 

Let us assume for a moment that the rolled-up sabot is not perfectly solid while traveling through the barrel during shooting. In this case, I suggest that the sabots were rolled clockwise when viewed from the rear. In this way, the rifling (turning clockwise on a Dreyse rifle) would tend to tighten the roll against the much heavier bullet's inertia. Rolled up in the opposite way, the sabots would loosen up due to shear stress and would neither guide the bullet properly nor communicate the spin from the rifling to the bullet.

I am planning to do some shooting tests to judge the influence of orientation. To be sure, my manufacturing process will most probably differ from the original (not only because I could not pick up the original glue used...), but it might be an interesting test nonetheless.
