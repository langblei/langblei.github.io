Most of the friends and colleagues I have told about my computational research on the Langblei were -- understandably -- sceptical as to why somebody would pursue such a topic in the first place. In the end, would anybody be interested? Is it worth the effort? Why this obscure Langblei? And what is the Langblei anyway?

The simplest answer to the *why* questions is that I just wanted to know the ballistics of the Langblei from a fluid dynamics point-of-view. There are some comments in books and on the web about the performance of the Langblei as a projectile, including some contradictions and misconceptions. I simply wanted to contribute some scientfic research to any future discussion on the topic, thus helping to at least exclude some phenomena from the list of speculative properties of the Langblei.

Also, I was hoping to find out some interesting things by trying a computational approach on a merely historical topic. Having read a lot of military history, I find that many arguments used to decide about, say, the decisiveness of a weapon in a given war, are incomplete, unbalanced and often little supported by facts. In most cases, to be sure, such information cannot be gained in hindsight. Nevertheless, I believe that those pieces of arguments that can be scientifically investigated should be addressed in order to move towards a more profound historical picture. Today's computational tools, some of which I am going to use in the coming posts, are very powerful and often rather easy to use. For instance, why not make more use of probabilistic models in questions of history, allowing for assessing the significance of certain conclusions based on the underlying data? To be honest, this neither is an approach that I would be prepared to take nor one that has any immediate application the Langblei case at hand. Instead, I decided to examine the Langblei in flight by methods of computational fluid dynamics (*CFD*), classical mechanics, and -- rather basic -- optimization, supported by some literature research. More on that in the future.

Is it worth the effort? Being a hobby, the research on the Langblei need not pay off in any way except in terms of the fun-frustration balance. Being research, each small, solid (i.e. documented, reproducible) step upwards helps in my opinion. Anyway, I have been and am still doing the research out of interest, so for me it is worth it. However, I shall be very glad to spark some interest in somebody who encounters this website. This, I admit, would be quite rewarding. Feel free to reach out to me with questions, comments, and criticism, or if you would like to contribute.

The last two questions I will address in future posts.
