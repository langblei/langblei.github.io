As mentioned in the [this post](../thoughts-on-dreyse-sabots), detailed descriptions on manufacturing Dreyse sabots appears to be lacking. This is probably due to archives being destroyed during World War 2. However, a few notes can be found in contemporary literature. 

The richest description is also the oldest, namely the one given by Wilhelm von Pönnies in his 1865 treatise *Das Zündnadelgewehr. Beiträge zur Kritik der Hinterladungswaffe*, starting on page 118. Von Plönnies states that the Spiegel is made of 0.125 mm thick paper which is first rolled around a spindle ("Dorn") with a thin end. He provides a sketch showing the sabot after the winding process:
